rum [<static_dir>] <outfile> [-- <browserify>]
  Watchify plus static file server plus auto-reload.

Options:
  <static_dir>  Directory of static files to serve, images/fonts
                If omitted, the server is disabled

  <outfile>     Required. Where to dump the browserify bundle

  <browserify>  Arguments after the '--' will be passed along to browserify

  --exec, -x    Shell command to run on each update before browserify,
                and before reload. Will capture any preceeding
                --watch arguments, which are not already captured by
                another --exec. Can use this multiple times.

  --watch, -w   Additional glob pattern to monitor for changes.
                Can use this multiple times. Position is important.
                Will apply to the next --exec argument or to the
                browserify watcher if one is not found.

  --port, -p    Bind server to this [address:]port instead of 0.0.0.0 and
                and random port

  --router, -r  Redirect all requests to this path but keep the
                displayed url unchanged. Use this if you've got
                client-side routing and want to avoid 404s.

  --version, -v Show version number

Basic usage:
  rum dist dist/bundle.js -- src/index.js
Watch scss:
  rum -w 'src/**/*.scss' -x 'make dist/bundle.css' dist dist/bundle.js -- src/index.js
More browserify options:
  rum dist dist/bundle.js -- src/index.js -t babelify -t [envify purge]
